This repo contains several scripts to test the CLI interface of students in the class ECE 461 at Purdue.

NOTE: YOU MUST MANUALLY SET THE GITHUB TOKEN IN checker.py!

By running `python3 checker.py` in the same directory as their run script, students can verify that their CLI commands match the format we expect for the autograder.

If you have any questions, come to office hours.
